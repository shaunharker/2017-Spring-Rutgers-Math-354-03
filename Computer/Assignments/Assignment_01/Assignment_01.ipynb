This is just another convention; the last number is one-past-the-end. The motivation for this convention comes from the indexing starting at $0$ and programmers wanting the notation for \"the first `n` elements\" to be written succinctly as `0:n` rather than the awkward `0:(n-1)` which would be necessary if the right endpoint was included. It also ends up being nice in the sense that `a:b` will mean to use the `b-a` indices starting at `a`. It also ends up nice in that `a:b` and `b:c` fit together; if both of them had $b$ they would share an index. You can think of `a:b` as meaning the integers in the interval $[a, b)$.\n",
