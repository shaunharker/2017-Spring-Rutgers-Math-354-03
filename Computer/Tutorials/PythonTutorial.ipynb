    "A bit of a caveat about division. There are actually two flavors of Python; the older `2.*` versions, and the newer `3.*` versions. The older versions, when given something like `5/2`, will actually return `2`. The reason is because they want to divide integers and return an integer, so what it does is it always rounds down to an integer result. This is called _floor division_. If you want the remainder, you can get it with the \"modulus\" operator `%`. For example `142 % 100` divides `142` by `100` and returns the remainder, which is `42`.\n",
    "\n",
